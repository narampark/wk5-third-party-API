# Weekly Scheduler

## Description
This project was done to use third party APIs to dynamically change the webpage. The webpage uses dayjs to display the current date on the top of page. The timeblocks are separated hourly on a standard 9am to 5pm work schedule. They are also color coded to represent the past, present, or future activities to the current hour. When the user inputs their schedule in the timeblock and clicks on the save button, the information gets stored in their local storage. The stored user input is called up from the local storage and displayed on the webpage even when it is refreshed.
